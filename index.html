    <p>Hi there.</p>
    <p>We got married back in 2011, so this site isnâ€™t quite useful anymore, but it will still live because we run email off the domain.</p>
    <p>One of these days I may get around to updating the site to have the photo album, maybe check back in a few weeks or years?</p>
    <p>If you need to get in contact with us, try reaching out to Devin on his <a href="https://scaryuncledevin.com/" target="_blank">site</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks for dropping by!</p>
